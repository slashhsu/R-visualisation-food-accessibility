# The Impact of Deprived Areas and Population Density on Food Accessibility in the UK

## Overview
This project examines how deprived areas and population density affect food accessibility in the UK. Using data visualisation and statistical analysis, we explore the relationship between food availability, poverty levels, and population distribution to identify key areas for policy intervention.

## 1. Knowledge Building
### Background:
- **Food deserts** exist in many urban and rural areas, where people have limited access to affordable, nutritious food.
- **Geographical accessibility** and **poverty** are major factors influencing food access.
- The **Priority Places for Food Index (PPFI)** and **Census 2021 Population Density Data** provide valuable insights into food accessibility challenges.

### Data Sources:
- **Food Priority Data:** Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC)
- **Population Density Data:** Office for National Statistics (ONS)
- **Deprivation Index Data:** CDRC & Government Reports

## 2. Data Exploration & Visualisation
### Population Density vs. Food Priority Index
- **Red zones** indicate the highest food priority areas, mostly in **coastal and rural regions**.
- **Urban centres, such as London, have high food sufficiency**, highlighting the rural-urban divide.

### Poverty vs. Food Accessibility
- **High-poverty regions correlate with high food priority needs.**
- **England has more food-secure regions**, whereas **Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland face greater food insecurity**.

### Average Food Priority by Country
- **England has the highest level of food provision**, while the other three countries lag significantly.

## 3. Theoretical Framework
### **ASSET Framework**
- **A:** Identifying the impact of poverty and population density on food accessibility.
- **S:** Data collection from reliable sources like CDRC and ONS.
- **S:** Cleaning, processing, and visualising the data for meaningful insights.
- **E:** Using maps, scatter plots, and other visual tools to illustrate relationships.
- **T:** Drawing conclusions on food accessibility disparities and proposing solutions.

## 4. Implications & Improvements
ðŸ“Œ **Rural and coastal areas need urgent food accessibility improvements.**
ðŸ“Œ **Policymakers should focus on high-poverty, low-access areas.**
ðŸ“Œ **Urban areas like London show better food security, emphasizing inequality.**
ðŸ“Œ **Supermarkets and policymakers should collaborate to improve rural food access.**
